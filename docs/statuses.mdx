# Statuses

Statuses are workflow states for sessions and tasks (for example: Todo, In Progress, Done).

## Why They Matter

- Better inbox triage
- Clear progress tracking across projects
- Cleaner archive behavior

## Sessions vs Tasks

Normies uses statuses across both:

- Regular conversations
- Project task conversations

For projects, statuses become the visible progress layer that drives what to do next.

## Common Workflow Pattern

Typical progression:

1. `Todo`
2. `In Progress`
3. `Needs Review` (optional)
4. `Done` or `Cancelled`

## Operational Guidance

- Keep status names explicit and team-readable.
- Avoid redundant states that overlap semantically.
- Reserve closed states for genuinely complete/ended work.
