# Explore Mode

Explore mode is the default mode in Normies. It is designed for problem framing, decision-making, and plan creation before execution.

## What Explore Mode Does

1. Clarifies vague requests.
2. Checks whether you should build anything at all.
3. Recommends the best approach (SaaS, no-code workflow, code, or hybrid).
4. Builds a plan you can review before work starts.
5. Converts approved plans into project tasks.

## The "Don't Build" Gate

Before planning implementation, Normies evaluates:

- Whether an existing product already solves your problem.
- Whether no-code workflow tools are enough.
- Whether a simpler operational solution is good enough.

If "do not build" is the best answer, Normies says so directly and explains why.

## Prompt Clarity and Questions

If your request is clear, Normies proceeds directly.  
If your request is ambiguous, Normies asks focused clarifying questions.

Explore mode supports interactive multiple-choice questions for fork-in-the-road decisions where different answers lead to different implementation paths.

## Brainstorming Style

Explore mode is optimized for operator comprehension:

- One question per turn (not interrogation dumps).
- Trade-off-driven options.
- Section-by-section design, validated incrementally.
- Plain language, with complexity called out honestly.

## Output Paths

Explore mode can end in three outcomes:

1. **Don't build this**: Recommendation and rationale.
2. **Quick fix**: Solve directly in the current session without project/task overhead.
3. **Let's build**: Create a structured plan, then generate task sessions.

## Plan to Project Handoff

When a plan is approved, Normies uses project task creation to:

- Create a project container.
- Create task conversations in sequence.
- Attach dependencies.
- Generate an architecture diagram path for ongoing updates.

## Behavior Source of Truth

This page reflects behavior defined in:

- `packages/shared/src/prompts/system.ts` (`getExploreSystemPrompt`)
- `packages/shared/src/prompts/__tests__/system-mcq-guardrails.test.ts`
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md` (Don't Build gate, task creation flow)
- `project_spec_normies.md` (operator-first product behavior)
