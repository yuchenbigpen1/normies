# Release Checklist

Use this before sharing a DMG/installer with other people.

## 1. Code and Build Health

Run:

```bash
bun run typecheck:all
bun test
bun run build
```

## 2. Package Validation

For macOS:

```bash
bun run release
```

Expected artifact path:
- `apps/electron/release/Normies-arm64.dmg` or `apps/electron/release/Normies-x64.dmg`

## 3. Branding and Links

Confirm:
- App name is `Normies`
- Icon is correct in dock/installer
- Help/Learn More links point to Normies docs (not Craft docs)

## 4. Distribution Decision

- **Private testing only**: unsigned DMG can work, but users may need extra security prompts.
- **Public sharing**: use Apple code signing + notarization for smooth install experience.

## 5. Optional Upload/Update Channel

If you use hosted updates, run the upload flow with S3 environment variables configured.
