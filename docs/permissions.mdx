# Permissions

Permissions control how much autonomy the agent has.

## Modes (User View)

- **Explore**: discovery and planning mode with safety-first defaults.
- **Ask to Edit**: changes are proposed, then confirmed before execution.
- **Execute**: direct execution mode for implementation work.

## How Permissions Fit the Product Flow

1. Most work starts in Explore mode.
2. Explore gathers context and prepares a plan.
3. You approve transition into execution behavior.
4. Task work proceeds with appropriate permission level.

This keeps planning safe while still allowing fast execution when you choose.

## Configuration

Permissions are defined at app/workspace/source levels and merged at runtime.

Common rule categories include:

- Allowed MCP tool patterns.
- Allowed API endpoints.
- Allowed shell command patterns.
- Optional blocked tools and allowed write paths.

## Explore Mode Defaults

Explore mode is intentionally restrictive for safety:

- Read/search operations are broadly allowed.
- Mutation-heavy operations are blocked by default.
- Plan creation is allowed so you can move from exploration to approved execution.

## Source-Level Permission Design

Source permissions should enable meaningful read operations in Explore mode while preventing accidental writes.

For MCP sources, source-level patterns are auto-scoped to reduce leakage across sources.

## UX Requirement: Plain-Language Prompts

When user confirmation is needed, prompts should explain the action in plain language rather than raw command syntax.
