# Skills

Skills are reusable instruction sets that extend how Normies handles specific tasks.

## What Skills Are Used For

Use skills when you want consistent behavior for recurring work, such as:

- Setup workflows
- Review/checklist workflows
- Team-specific conventions
- Domain-specific procedures

## How Skills Work in Normies

- Skills live in workspace scope, so different workspaces can behave differently.
- Skills can be invoked directly in chat.
- Skills can also be auto-suggested based on context or file patterns.

## Skill Structure

- A folder per skill
- `SKILL.md` file with frontmatter and instructions
- Optional helper files/scripts

## Compatibility

Normies skill format is compatible with Claude Code style `SKILL.md` structure, with workspace organization and UI support layered on top.

## Best Practices

- Keep each skill focused on one workflow.
- Write clear trigger/usage criteria.
- Prefer concrete steps over abstract policy statements.
- Include examples of good and bad outcomes.

## Validation

Validate new skills before use to catch formatting or instruction issues.
