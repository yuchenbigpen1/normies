# Sources

Sources connect external systems to Normies so the agent can read, search, and act with real business context.

## Supported Source Types

- MCP servers
- REST APIs
- Local folders

## Why Sources Matter

- They let Normies work with your real tools (CRM, issue trackers, docs, files).
- They reduce manual copy/paste between systems.
- They make project and task execution more accurate because the agent can verify against live data.

## Setup Model

Each source generally includes:

- Connection/auth configuration.
- Optional usage guidance (`guide.md`) tailored to your workflow.
- Permission rules for safe use in Explore mode.

Normies is designed to configure sources conversationally, then validate before use.

## Explore Mode and Safety

Sources should still be useful in Explore mode:

- Read/search/list operations are typically enabled.
- Mutating operations should remain blocked unless explicitly allowed.

For source-level MCP permissions, simple patterns are auto-scoped to that source to reduce accidental cross-source access.

## Validation Requirement

After creating or editing a source, run source validation before relying on it.  
Validation checks schema, connectivity, and missing metadata.

## Recommended Setup Flow

1. Define business goal and scope.
2. Configure source details and auth.
3. Add read-safe permissions for Explore mode.
4. Validate the source.
5. Authenticate if required.
6. Test with a real query in the app.
