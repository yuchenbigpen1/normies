# Workspaces

Workspaces separate context, configuration, and data.

A workspace can have its own:
- Sources
- Skills
- Statuses
- Labels
- Session history

Use workspaces to keep personal, team, and client contexts isolated.

## Why Workspaces Are Important

Workspaces are the primary boundary for:

- Permissions and safety posture
- Connected tools and data scope
- Process conventions

This prevents one project's setup from leaking into another.

## Recommended Workspace Strategy

Create separate workspaces by operational boundary, for example:

- Personal experiments
- Internal operations
- Client-facing delivery
- High-sensitivity environments
