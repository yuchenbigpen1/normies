# Preferences

Preferences are personal settings that help Normies tailor responses and UX.

Examples:
- Name/identity preferences
- Language or tone preferences
- Regional defaults

Preferences are user-level and intended to personalize behavior without changing core project config.

## What Preferences Should Capture

- Communication style you consistently prefer
- Locale/timezone context for scheduling and date-sensitive tasks
- Any recurring response format preferences

## What Preferences Should Not Do

Preferences should not replace:

- Workspace configuration
- Permission policy
- Source setup

Those belong to project/workspace governance, not personal profile behavior.
