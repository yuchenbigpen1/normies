# App Settings

App Settings are global defaults for your installation.

Common examples:
- Default model/provider
- Feature toggles
- Environment-level behavior

These settings apply across workspaces unless a workspace-level override exists.

## Global vs Workspace-Level

- Use App Settings for defaults you want everywhere.
- Use workspace-specific settings when one team/context needs different behavior.

## What to Configure Early

Recommended first-pass global setup:

1. Model/provider default
2. Preferred execution posture
3. Any org-wide behavior defaults

Then refine by workspace only where needed.
