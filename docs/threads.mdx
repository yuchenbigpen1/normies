# Threads (Second-Opinion Chat)

Threads let users open a side conversation on a specific assistant response without polluting the main execution flow.

## Purpose

- Ask follow-up questions
- Challenge or critique an answer
- Get a second opinion before continuing the main flow

## Behavior

- Thread conversation is separate from the main session flow.
- Threads are discussion-only: critique, clarification, decision support.
- The thread assistant does not continue primary implementation work.
- Thread conclusions can be turned into ready-to-paste feedback for the main conversation.

## UX Model

1. Open thread from a specific assistant response.
2. Discuss that response in the overlay thread context.
3. Bring decisions back into the main conversation.

Thread sessions are hidden from standard chat lists and are linked to a specific parent message.

## Why Threads Exist

Threads are a built-in quality control and comprehension mechanism:

- Challenge assumptions without derailing execution.
- Clarify complex technical choices in plain language.
- Keep the main conversation focused and clean.
