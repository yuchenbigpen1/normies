# Normies Documentation

Normies helps non-technical operators run workflows with AI assistance.

This docs set is the reference for how Normies works in practice: explore, plan, execute, and review.

## Start Here

1. Read [Explore Mode](./explore-mode) to understand decision flow.
2. Read [Projects and Tasks](./projects-and-tasks) and [Task Execution System](./task-execution-system).
3. Use [Sources](./sources), [Skills](./skills), and [Permissions](./permissions) to configure behavior.
4. Review [Threads](./threads) and [Architecture Diagrams](./architecture-diagrams) for comprehension and quality control.

## Local Development

```bash
npx mintlify dev
```

## Source of Truth

Product and implementation source material is in:
- `project_spec_normies.md`
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md`
- `TASK_PLAN.md`

## Release Sharing
