# Projects and Tasks

Normies turns approved plans into tracked projects made of task conversations.

## Core Model

A project is a group of related sessions:

- One parent Explore conversation (planning context).
- Multiple task conversations (execution units).

Each task is independently visible, startable, and reviewable.

## Lifecycle

1. Explore mode produces a plan.
2. Plan approval triggers task creation.
3. Tasks appear under the project in the Projects navigation.
4. User starts tasks intentionally (human-gated execution).
5. Tasks move through statuses as work progresses.
6. Completed tasks save a plain-language summary.

## Why This Helps

- You can see real progress across a multi-step initiative.
- You can re-enter work after a break without losing context.
- You can inspect each task as its own conversation history.

## What You See in the UI

- **Left sidebar**: Projects group with expandable project list.
- **Middle panel**: Ordered task list with status and subtitle summary.
- **Right sidebar**: Task description, dependencies, file scope, and context.

## Task Session Metadata

Task sessions track execution-specific context such as:

- Task order index.
- Dependency links.
- Parent session link.
- Task completion summary.

This is what enables project-level progress and task-specific UX.
