# Projects and Tasks

Normies can turn a plan into a tracked project with task sessions.

## How It Works

1. Explore session produces a plan.
2. Project tasks are created from that plan.
3. Each task runs as its own conversation.
4. Task progress is visible in the Projects view.

## Why This Helps

- Clear sequencing for multi-step work
- Better visibility into what is done vs pending
- Easier handoff and review
