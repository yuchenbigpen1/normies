# Labels

Labels help organize sessions with tags and optional structured values.

## Use Cases

- Categorize work by project or team
- Add priority tags
- Filter sessions quickly

## Labels vs Statuses

- **Status** is exclusive (one workflow state at a time).
- **Labels** are additive (multiple tags can coexist).

Use statuses for lifecycle, labels for classification.

## Label Design Tips

- Keep a small, meaningful top-level taxonomy.
- Use nested labels when teams need hierarchy.
- Add typed values only when they drive real filtering or reporting.
- Use consistent color semantics so scanning stays fast.

## Auto-Labeling

Labels can be applied automatically using pattern rules, which is useful for issue keys, links, and structured identifiers.
