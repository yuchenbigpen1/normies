# Task Execution System

Task execution in Normies runs implementation as task conversations with strict quality and verification rules.

## How Execution Starts

Task execution is user-gated:

1. Task is created in Todo state.
2. User opens the task conversation.
3. User clicks Start.
4. Task transitions into active execution.

## Execution Principles

Task mode enforces:

- Test-driven development by default.
- Verification before completion claims.
- Error logging with no repeated failed approach loops.
- Re-checking task context before major decisions.

## Mid-Execution Replanning

If execution hits repeated verification failures or a plan conflict:

- Normies pauses and explains the issue in plain language.
- Normies asks whether to try a new approach or revisit broader planning.

This protects users from silent drift and hidden failure loops.

## Completion Contract

Before a task is considered complete, Normies should:

1. Save a plain-language completion summary.
2. Update project architecture context when applicable.
3. Provide user-verifiable validation steps in plain language.

## Why This Matters

This system is designed to prevent:

- "Looks done" claims without proof.
- Large hidden implementation jumps.
- Loss of user understanding across long projects.

## Behavior Source of Truth

This page reflects behavior defined in:

- `packages/shared/src/prompts/system.ts` (`getTaskExecutionSystemPrompt`)
- `packages/shared/src/prompts/__tests__/system-task-execution.test.ts`
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md` (Task execution + post-task rules)
- `TASK_PLAN.md` (Task 5, Task 11, Task 19)
